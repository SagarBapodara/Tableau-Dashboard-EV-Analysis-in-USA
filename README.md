# Problem Statement

The repository will provide an analytical dashboard focused on the electric vehicle market, highlighting key metrics such as the total number of electric vehicles (EVs), their average electric range, and the share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Through visualizations like line charts, maps, and bar charts, the project aims to reveal market trends, adoption rates, and manufacturer dominance from 2010 onwards. 

# Dataset
